Teaching at Waterloo has always been less about delivering knowledge, and more about opening doors to discovery.

From the 20,000-square-foot Student Design Centre in Engineering 5, to undergraduate research fellowships in areas including health promotion, involving students in research starting at the undergraduate level is a teaching priority at Waterloo.

The Centre for Teaching Excellence fosters teaching and learning of the highest quality at Waterloo, supporting the development of instruction by working collaboratively with departments and individuals at all career stages.
